# Database Schema Scripts

This folder contains the SQL schema definition file `schema.sql` for the Airbnb clone project.

The `schema.sql` file includes all CREATE TABLE statements for entities like User, Property, Booking, Payment, Review, and Message.  
It also defines primary keys, foreign keys, constraints, and indexes for data integrity and query performance.
